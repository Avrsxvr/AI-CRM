## 🚀 Overview

**Apexora AI CRM** is an enterprise-grade, AI-native platform designed to redefine how sales teams capture, process, and engage with leads at trade shows, conferences, and networking events.

## ✨ Core Features

### 🎙️ Intelligent Lead Capture (The 4-Step Wizard)
Built for the chaos of the exhibition floor, our capture engine ensures data entry happens in seconds.
* **AI Business Card OCR:** Simply snap a photo of a business card. The AI engine instantly extracts the Name, Company, Email, Phone, and Job Title with pinpoint accuracy.
* **Rapid Context Notes:** Add quick text notes about the lead's specific interests to inform follow-ups.
* **Voice Dictation:** Speak naturally into your device to record a voice memo. The AI automatically transcribes speech and extracts structured JSON data (Name, Company, Intent, Tone).
* **Instant Review & Submit:** Review the AI-extracted data and save the lead instantly to your cloud database.

### 🧠 Automated Lead Scoring & Intelligence
* **AI Lead Grading:** The platform automatically analyzes the lead's job title and context notes to assign a priority score: **Hot**, **Warm**, or **Cold**.
* **Rich Profiles:** Every lead profile displays a clean timeline of when they were captured, their associated campaign, and all attached notes and transcripts.

### ✉️ Adaptive Email Engine (E1S1 / E1S2 Architecture)
The core brain of the CRM handles all post-event communication autonomously.
* **Intelligent Subject Rotation:** Uses E1S1 (Email 1, Subject 1). If a lead ignores it, the system automatically sends E1S2 (same content, more attractive subject line).
* **Smart Drafting:** Gemini AI reads transcription notes and drafts highly personalized emails (e.g., "Great chatting with you about X at the booth...").
* **Cold Lead Filtering & Hot Lead Progression:** Automatically halts sequences for unresponsive leads while progressing engaged leads who open your emails.
* **Tracking & Analytics:** Native email open tracking via pixel injection automatically upgrades lead status to "Hot" when engagement is detected.

### 🔗 Enterprise Integrations
Data flows seamlessly into your existing enterprise stack.
* **Zoho CRM Sync:** A dedicated background service automatically pushes new leads and custom fields (like `exhibition` and `stall`) directly into Zoho CRM.
* **Google Sheets Fallback:** Ensures zero data loss by automatically logging leads in Google Sheets if external APIs experience downtime.

### 🔐 Security & Multi-Tenancy
* **Dynamic Multi-Tenancy:** Users are assigned an `organization_id` ensuring data isolation across organizations.
* **Supabase Authentication:** Fully secured using Supabase Server-Side Rendering (SSR) Authentication.
* **Row Level Security (RLS):** Physical database-level enforcement rejects unauthorized data access instantly.
